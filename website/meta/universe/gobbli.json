    "description": "gobbli is a Python library which wraps several modern deep learning models in a uniform interface that makes it easy to evaluate feasibility and conduct analyses. It leverages the abstractive powers of Docker to hide nearly all dependency management and functional differences between models from the user. It also contains an interactive app for exploring text data and evaluating classification models. spaCy's base text classification models, as well as models integrated from `spacy-transformers`, are available in the collection of classification models. In addition, spaCy is used for data augmentation and document embeddings.",
