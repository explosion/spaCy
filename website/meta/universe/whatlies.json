    "description": "This small library offers tools to make visualisation easier of both word embeddings as well as operations on them. It has support for spaCy prebuilt models as a first class citizen but also offers support for sense2vec. There's a convenient API to perform linear algebra as well as support for popular transformations like PCA/UMAP/etc.",
