In this episode, Matt and Ines of Explosion AI tell us how Prodigy can improve data annotation and model development workflows. Prodigy is an annotation tool implemented as a python library, and it comes with a web application and a command line interface. A developer can define input data streams and design simple annotation interfaces. Prodigy can help break down complex annotation decisions into a series of binary decisions, and it provides easy integration with spaCy models. Developers can specify how models should be modified as new annotations come in in an active learning framework.", "soundcloud": "559200912", "thumb": "https://i.imgur.com/hOBQEzc.jpg", "url": "https://soundcloud.com/nlp-highlights/78-where-do-corpora-come-from-with-matt-honnibal-and-ines-montani", "author": "Matt Gardner, Waleed Ammar (Allen AI)", "author_links": {"website": "https://soundcloud.com/nlp-highlights"}, "category": ["podcasts"]}
