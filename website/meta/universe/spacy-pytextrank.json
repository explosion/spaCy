    "description": "An implementation of TextRank in Python for use in spaCy pipelines which provides fast, effective phrase extraction from texts, along with extractive summarization. The graph algorithm works independent of a specific natural language and does not require domain knowledge. See (Mihalcea 2004) https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/papers/mihalcea.emnlp04.pdf",
