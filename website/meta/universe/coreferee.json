It is designed so that it is easy to add support for new languages and optimised for limited training data. It uses a mixture of neural networks and programmed rules. Please note you will need to [install models](https://github.com/explosion/coreferee#getting-started) before running the code example.", "pip": "coreferee", "category": ["pipeline", "models", "standalone"], "tags": ["coreference-resolution", "anaphora"], "code_example": ["import coreferee, spacy", "nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_trf')", "nlp.add_pipe('coreferee')", "doc = nlp('Although he was very busy with his work, Peter had had enough of it.
