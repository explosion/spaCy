When called on a `Doc` or `Span`, the object is given two attributes: `languages` (a list of up to 3 language codes) and `language_scores` (a dictionary mapping language codes to confidence scores between 0 and 1).\n\nspacy-cld is a little extension that wraps the [PYCLD2](https://github.com/aboSamoor/pycld2) Python library, which in turn wraps the [Compact Language Detector 2](https://github.com/CLD2Owners/cld2) C library originally built at Google for the Chromium project. CLD2 uses character n-grams as features and a Naive Bayes classifier to identify 80+ languages from Unicode text strings (or XML/HTML). It can detect up to 3 different languages in a given document, and reports a confidence score (reported in with each language.", "github": "nickdavidhaynes/spacy-cld", "pip": "spacy_cld", "code_example": ["import spacy", "from spacy_cld import LanguageDetector", "", "nlp = spacy.load('en')", "language_detector = LanguageDetector()", "nlp.add_pipe(language_detector)", "doc = nlp('This is some English text.')", "", "doc._.languages  # ['en']", "doc._.language_scores['en']  # 0.96"], "author": "Nicholas D Haynes", "author_links": {"github": "nickdavidhaynes"}, "category": ["pipeline"]}
