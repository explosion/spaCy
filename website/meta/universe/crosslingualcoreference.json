In our case, the available training for non-English languages also data proved to be poorly annotated. Crosslingual Coreference therefore uses the assumption a trained model with English data and cross-lingual embeddings should work for other languages with similar sentence structure. Verified to work quite well for at least (EN, NL, DK, FR, DE).", "github": "pandora-intelligence/crosslingual-coreference", "pip": "crosslingual-coreference", "thumb": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pandora-Intelligence/crosslingual-coreference/master/img/logo.png", "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pandora-Intelligence/crosslingual-coreference/master/img/example_total.png", "code_example": ["import spacy", "import crosslingual_coreference", "", "text = \"\"\"", "    Do not forget about Momofuku Ando!", "    He created instant noodles in Osaka.", "    At that location, Nissin was founded.", "    Many students survived by eating these noodles, but they don't even know him.\"\"\"", "", "# use any model that has internal spacy embeddings", "nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')", "nlp.add_pipe(", "    \"xx_coref\", config={\"chunk_size\": 2500, \"chunk_overlap\": 2, \"device\": 0})", ")", "", "doc = nlp(text)", "", "print(doc._.coref_clusters)", "# Output", "#", "# [[[4, 5], [7, 7], [27, 27], [36, 36]],", "# [[12, 12], [15, 16]],", "# [[9, 10], [27, 28]],", "# [[22, 23], [31, 31]]]", "print(doc._.resolved_text)", "# Output", "#", "# Do not forget about Momofuku Ando!", "# Momofuku Ando created instant noodles in Osaka.", "# At Osaka, Nissin was founded.", "# Many students survived by eating instant noodles,", "# but Many students don't even know Momofuku Ando."], "author": "David Berenstein", "author_links": {"github": "davidberenstein1957", "website": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-berenstein-1bab11105/"}, "category": ["pipeline", "standalone"], "tags": ["coreference", "multi-lingual", "cross-lingual", "allennlp"], "spacy_version": 3}
