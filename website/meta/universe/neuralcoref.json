    "slogan": "State-of-the-art coreference resolution based on neural nets and spaCy",
    "description": "This coreference resolution module is based on the super fast [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) parser and uses the neural net scoring model described in [Deep Reinforcement Learning for Mention-Ranking Coreference Models](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/kevclark/resources/clark-manning-emnlp2016-deep.pdf) by Kevin Clark and Christopher D. Manning, EMNLP 2016. Since \u2728Neuralcoref v2.0, you can train the coreference resolution system on your own dataset\u200a\u2014\u200ae.g., another language than English!\u200a\u2014\u200a**provided you have an annotated dataset**. Note that to use neuralcoref with spaCy > 2.1.0, you'll have to install neuralcoref from source.",
