    "description": "DaCy is a Danish preprocessing pipeline trained in SpaCy. It has achieved State-of-the-Art performance on Named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing for Danish. This repository contains material for using the DaCy, reproducing the results and guides on usage of the package. Furthermore, it also contains a series of behavioural test for biases and robustness of Danish NLP pipelines.",
