Classy Classification is the way to go! For few-shot classification using [sentence-transformers](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers) or [spaCy models](https://spacy.io/usage/models), provide a dictionary with labels and examples, or just provide a list of labels for zero shot-classification with [Huggingface zero-shot classifiers](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=zero-shot-classification).",
