To help us write docs, tutorials and blog posts about spaCy, we've developed a powerful set of modularized markup components, implemented using Jade.",

This post motivates the idea, explains our implementation, and comes with an interactive demo that we've found surprisingly addictive.",

Second, how can we make dependency trees easy for humans to create?",
