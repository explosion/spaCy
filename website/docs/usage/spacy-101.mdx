## What's spaCy? {id="whats-spacy"}

<Grid cols={2}>

<div>

spaCy is a **free, open-source library** for advanced **Natural Language
Processing** (NLP) in Python.

If you're working with a lot of text, you'll eventually want to know more about
it. For example, what's it about? What do the words mean in context? Who is
doing what to whom? What companies and products are mentioned? Which texts are
similar to each other?

spaCy is designed specifically for **production use** and helps you build
applications that process and "understand" large volumes of text. It can be used
to build **information extraction** or **natural language understanding**
systems, or to pre-process text for **deep learning**.

### What spaCy isn't {id="what-spacy-isnt"}

- ❌ **spaCy is not a platform or "an API"**. Unlike a platform, spaCy does not
  provide a software as a service, or a web application. It's an open-source
  library designed to help you build NLP applications, not a consumable service.
- ❌ **spaCy is not an out-of-the-box chat bot engine**. While spaCy can be used
  to power conversational applications, it's not designed specifically for chat
  bots, and only provides the underlying text processing capabilities.
- ❌**spaCy is not research software**. It's built on the latest research, but
  it's designed to get things done. This leads to fairly different design
  decisions than [NLTK](https://github.com/nltk/nltk) or
  [CoreNLP](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/), which were created as
  platforms for teaching and research. The main difference is that spaCy is
  integrated and opinionated. spaCy tries to avoid asking the user to choose
  between multiple algorithms that deliver equivalent functionality. Keeping the
  menu small lets spaCy deliver generally better performance and developer
  experience.
- ❌ **spaCy is not a company**. It's an open-source library. Our company
  publishing spaCy and other software is called
  [Explosion](https://explosion.ai).

## Features {id="features"}

In the documentation, you'll come across mentions of spaCy's features and
capabilities. Some of them refer to linguistic concepts, while others are
related to more general machine learning functionality.

### Statistical models {id="statistical-models"}

While some of spaCy's features work independently, others require
[trained pipelines](/models) to be loaded, which enable spaCy to **predict**
linguistic annotations – for example, whether a word is a verb or a noun. A
trained pipeline can consist of multiple components that use a statistical model
trained on labeled data. spaCy currently offers trained pipelines for a variety
of languages, which can be installed as individual Python modules. Pipeline
packages can differ in size, speed, memory usage, accuracy and the data they
include. The package you choose always depends on your use case and the texts
you're working with. For a general-purpose use case, the small, default packages
are always a good start. They typically include the following components:

- **Binary weights** for the part-of-speech tagger, dependency parser and named
  entity recognizer to predict those annotations in context.
- **Lexical entries** in the vocabulary, i.e. words and their
  context-independent attributes like the shape or spelling.
- **Data files** like lemmatization rules and lookup tables.
- **Word vectors**, i.e. multi-dimensional meaning representations of words that
  let you determine how similar they are to each other.
- **Configuration** options, like the language and processing pipeline settings
  and model implementations to use, to put spaCy in the correct state when you
  load the pipeline.

## Linguistic annotations {id="annotations"}

spaCy provides a variety of linguistic annotations to give you **insights into a
text's grammatical structure**. This includes the word types, like the parts of
speech, and how the words are related to each other. For example, if you're
analyzing text, it makes a huge difference whether a noun is the subject of a
sentence, or the object – or whether "google" is used as a verb, or refers to
the website or company in a specific context.

> #### Loading pipelines
>
> ```bash
> $ python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
>
> >>> import spacy
> >>> nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
> ```

Once you've [downloaded and installed](/usage/models) a trained pipeline, you
can load it via [`spacy.load`](/api/top-level#spacy.load). This will return a
`Language` object containing all components and data needed to process text. We
usually call it `nlp`. Calling the `nlp` object on a string of text will return
a processed `Doc`:

```python {executable="true"}
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
doc = nlp("Apple is looking at buying U.K. startup for $1 billion")
for token in doc:
    print(token.text, token.pos_, token.dep_)
```

Even though a `Doc` is processed – e.g. split into individual words and
annotated – it still holds **all information of the original text**, like
whitespace characters. You can always get the offset of a token into the
original string, or reconstruct the original by joining the tokens and their
trailing whitespace. This way, you'll never lose any information when processing
text with spaCy.

## Architecture {id="architecture"}

<Architecture101 />

## Vocab, hashes and lexemes {id="vocab"}

Whenever possible, spaCy tries to store data in a vocabulary, the
[`Vocab`](/api/vocab), that will be **shared by multiple documents**. To save
memory, spaCy also encodes all strings to **hash values** – in this case for
example, "coffee" has the hash `3197928453018144401`. Entity labels like "ORG"
and part-of-speech tags like "VERB" are also encoded. Internally, spaCy only
"speaks" in hash values.

> - **Token**: A word, punctuation mark etc. _in context_, including its
>   attributes, tags and dependencies.
> - **Lexeme**: A "word type" with no context. Includes the word shape and
>   flags, e.g. if it's lowercase, a digit or punctuation.
> - **Doc**: A processed container of tokens in context.
> - **Vocab**: The collection of lexemes.
> - **StringStore**: The dictionary mapping hash values to strings, for example
>   `3197928453018144401` → "coffee".

![Doc, Vocab, Lexeme and StringStore](/images/vocab_stringstore.svg)

If you process lots of documents containing the word "coffee" in all kinds of
different contexts, storing the exact string "coffee" every time would take up
way too much space. So instead, spaCy hashes the string and stores it in the
[`StringStore`](/api/stringstore). You can think of the `StringStore` as a
**lookup table that works in both directions** – you can look up a string to get
its hash, or a hash to get its string:

```python {executable="true"}
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
doc = nlp("I love coffee")
print(doc.vocab.strings["coffee"])  # 3197928453018144401
print(doc.vocab.strings[3197928453018144401])  # 'coffee'
```

Now that all strings are encoded, the entries in the vocabulary **don't need to
include the word text** themselves. Instead, they can look it up in the
`StringStore` via its hash value. Each entry in the vocabulary, also called
[`Lexeme`](/api/lexeme), contains the **context-independent** information about
a word. For example, no matter if "love" is used as a verb or a noun in some
context, its spelling and whether it consists of alphabetic characters won't
ever change. Its hash value will also always be the same.

```python {executable="true"}
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
doc = nlp("I love coffee")
for word in doc:
    lexeme = doc.vocab[word.text]
    print(lexeme.text, lexeme.orth, lexeme.shape_, lexeme.prefix_, lexeme.suffix_,
            lexeme.is_alpha, lexeme.is_digit, lexeme.is_title, lexeme.lang_)
```

> - **Text**: The original text of the lexeme.
> - **Orth**: The hash value of the lexeme.
> - **Shape**: The abstract word shape of the lexeme.
> - **Prefix**: By default, the first letter of the word string.
> - **Suffix**: By default, the last three letters of the word string.
> - **is alpha**: Does the lexeme consist of alphabetic characters?
> - **is digit**: Does the lexeme consist of digits?

| Text   | Orth                  | Shape  | Prefix | Suffix | is_alpha | is_digit |
| ------ | --------------------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | -------- | -------- |
| I      | `4690420944186131903` | `X`    | I      | I      | `True`   | `False`  |
| love   | `3702023516439754181` | `xxxx` | l      | ove    | `True`   | `False`  |
| coffee | `3197928453018144401` | `xxxx` | c      | fee    | `True`   | `False`  |

The mapping of words to hashes doesn't depend on any state. To make sure each
value is unique, spaCy uses a
[hash function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function) to calculate the
hash **based on the word string**. This also means that the hash for "coffee"
will always be the same, no matter which pipeline you're using or how you've
configured spaCy.

However, hashes **cannot be reversed** and there's no way to resolve
`3197928453018144401` back to "coffee". All spaCy can do is look it up in the
vocabulary. That's why you always need to make sure all objects you create have
access to the same vocabulary. If they don't, spaCy might not be able to find
the strings it needs.

```python {executable="true"}
import spacy
from spacy.tokens import Doc
from spacy.vocab import Vocab

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
doc = nlp("I love coffee")  # Original Doc
print(doc.vocab.strings["coffee"])  # 3197928453018144401
print(doc.vocab.strings[3197928453018144401])  # 'coffee' 👍

empty_doc = Doc(Vocab())  # New Doc with empty Vocab
# empty_doc.vocab.strings[3197928453018144401] will raise an error :(

empty_doc.vocab.strings.add("coffee")  # Add "coffee" and generate hash
print(empty_doc.vocab.strings[3197928453018144401])  # 'coffee' 👍

new_doc = Doc(doc.vocab)  # Create new doc with first doc's vocab
print(new_doc.vocab.strings[3197928453018144401])  # 'coffee' 👍
```

If the vocabulary doesn't contain a string for `3197928453018144401`, spaCy will
raise an error. You can re-add "coffee" manually, but this only works if you
actually _know_ that the document contains that word. To prevent this problem,
spaCy will also export the `Vocab` when you save a `Doc` or `nlp` object. This
will give you the object and its encoded annotations, plus the "key" to decode
it.

### Training config and lifecycle {id="training-config"}

Training config files include all **settings and hyperparameters** for training
your pipeline. Instead of providing lots of arguments on the command line, you
only need to pass your `config.cfg` file to [`spacy train`](/api/cli#train).
This also makes it easy to integrate custom models and architectures, written in
your framework of choice. A pipeline's `config.cfg` is considered the "single
source of truth", both at **training** and **runtime**.

> ```ini
> ### config.cfg (excerpt)
> [training]
> accumulate_gradient = 3
>
> [training.optimizer]
> @optimizers = "Adam.v1"
>
> [training.optimizer.learn_rate]
> @schedules = "warmup_linear.v1"
> warmup_steps = 250
> total_steps = 20000
> initial_rate = 0.01

### Trainable components {id="training-components"}

spaCy's [`Pipe`](/api/pipe) class helps you implement your own trainable
components that have their own model instance, make predictions over `Doc`
objects and can be updated using [`spacy train`](/api/cli#train). This lets you
plug fully custom machine learning components into your pipeline that can be
configured via a single training config.

> #### config.cfg (excerpt)

> ```ini
> [components.my_component]
> factory = "my_component"

### How can I contribute to spaCy? {id="faq-contributing"}

You don't have to be an NLP expert or Python pro to contribute, and we're happy
to help you get started. If you're new to spaCy, a good place to start is the
[`help wanted (easy)` label](https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A"help+wanted+%28easy%29")
on GitHub, which we use to tag bugs and feature requests that are easy and
self-contained. We also appreciate contributions to the docs – whether it's
fixing a typo, improving an example or adding additional explanations. You'll
find a "Suggest edits" link at the bottom of each page that points you to the
source.

Another way of getting involved is to help us improve the
[language data](/usage/linguistic-features#language-data) – especially if you
happen to speak one of the languages currently in
[alpha support](/usage/models#languages). Even adding simple tokenizer
exceptions, stop words or lemmatizer data can make a big difference. It will
also make it easier for us to provide a trained pipeline for the language in the
future. Submitting a test that documents a bug or performance issue, or covers
functionality that's especially important for your application is also very
helpful. This way, you'll also make sure we never accidentally introduce
regressions to the parts of the library that you care about the most.

**For more details on the types of contributions we're looking for, the code
conventions and other useful tips, make sure to check out the
[contributing guidelines](%%GITHUB_SPACY/CONTRIBUTING.md).**
