After tokenization, spaCy can **parse** and **tag** a given `Doc`. This is where
the trained pipeline and its statistical models come in, which enable spaCy to
**make predictions** of which tag or label most likely applies in this context.
A trained component includes binary data that is produced by showing a system
enough examples for it to make predictions that generalize across the language –
for example, a word following "the" in English is most likely a noun.

Linguistic annotations are available as
[`Token` attributes](/api/token#attributes). Like many NLP libraries, spaCy
**encodes all strings to hash values** to reduce memory usage and improve
efficiency. So to get the readable string representation of an attribute, we
need to add an underscore `_` to its name:

```python {executable="true"}
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
doc = nlp("Apple is looking at buying U.K. startup for $1 billion")

for token in doc:
    print(token.text, token.lemma_, token.pos_, token.tag_, token.dep_,
            token.shape_, token.is_alpha, token.is_stop)
```

> - **Text:** The original word text.
> - **Lemma:** The base form of the word.
> - **POS:** The simple [UPOS](https://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/)
>   part-of-speech tag.
> - **Tag:** The detailed part-of-speech tag.
> - **Dep:** Syntactic dependency, i.e. the relation between tokens.
> - **Shape:** The word shape – capitalization, punctuation, digits.
> - **is alpha:** Is the token an alpha character?
> - **is stop:** Is the token part of a stop list, i.e. the most common words of
>   the language?

> #### Tip: Understanding tags and labels

> Most of the tags and labels look pretty abstract, and they vary between
> languages. `spacy.explain` will show you a short description – for example,
> `spacy.explain("VBZ")` returns "verb, 3rd person singular present".

Using spaCy's built-in [displaCy visualizer](/usage/visualizers), here's what
our example sentence and its dependencies look like:
