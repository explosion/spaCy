p
    |  spaCy is compatible with #[strong 64-bit CPython 2.6+&#8725;3.3+] and
    |  runs on #[strong Unix/Linux], #[strong macOS/OS X] and
    |  #[strong Windows]. The latest spaCy releases are currently only
    |  available as source packages over
    |  #[+a("https://pypi.python.org/pypi/spacy") pip]. Installaton requires a
    |  working build environment. See notes on
    |  #[a(href="#source-ubuntu") Ubuntu], #[a(href="#source-osx") macOS/OS X]
    |  and #[a(href="#source-windows") Windows] for details.

+code(false, "bash").
    pip install -U spacy

p
    |  After installation you need to download a language model. Models for
    |  English (#[code en]) and German (#[code de]) are available.

+code(false, "bash").
    python -m spacy.en.download all
    python -m spacy.de.download all

+aside-code("Examples", "bash").
    # Install English tagger, parser and NER
    python -m spacy.en.download parser

    # Install English GloVe vectors
    python -m spacy.en.download glove

    # Upgrade/overwrite existing data
    python -m spacy.en.download --force

    # Check whether the model was successfully installed
    python -c "import spacy; spacy.load('en'); print('OK')"

p The download command fetches about 1 GB of data which it installs within the #[code spacy] package directory.

+h(2, "source") Compile from source

p
    |  The other way to install spaCy is to clone its
    |  #[+a(gh("spaCy")) GitHub repository] and build it from source. That is
    |  the common way if you want to make changes to the code base.

p
    |  You'll need to make sure that you have a development enviroment
    |  consisting of a Python distribution including header files, a compiler,
    |  #[+a("https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing/") pip],
    |  #[+a("https://virtualenv.pypa.io/") virtualenv] and
    |  #[+a("https://git-scm.com") git] installed. The compiler part is the
    |  trickiest. How to do that depends on your system. See notes on
    |  #[a(href="#source-ubuntu") Ubuntu], #[a(href="#source-osx") OS X] and
    |  #[a(href="#source-windows") Windows] for details.

+h(3, "source-ubuntu") Ubuntu

p Install system-level dependencies via #[code apt-get]:

+code(false, "bash").
    sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev git

+h(3, "source-osx") macOS / OS X

p
    |  Install a recent version of #[+a("https://developer.apple.com/xcode/") XCode],
    |  including the so-called "Command Line Tools". macOS and OS X ship with
    |  Python and git preinstalled.

p
    |  To compile spaCy with multi-threading support on macOS / OS X,
    |  #[+a("https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/issues/267") see here].


+h(3, "source-windows") Windows

p
    |  Install a version of
    |  #[+a("https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/visual-studio-express/") Visual Studio Express]
    |  that matches the version that was used to compile your Python
    |  interpreter. For official distributions these are:

+table([ "Distribution", "Version"])
    +row
        +cell Python 2.7
        +cell Visual Studio 2008

    +row
        +cell Python 3.4
        +cell Visual Studio 2010

    +row
        +cell Python 3.5
        +cell Visual Studio 2015

+h(2, "tests") Run tests

p
    |  spaCy comes with an extensive test suite. First, find out where spaCy is
    |  installed:

+code(false, "bash").
    python -c "import os; import spacy; print(os.path.dirname(spacy.__file__))"

p
    |  Then run #[code pytest] on that directory. The flags #[code --vectors],
    |  #[code --slow] and #[code --model] are optional and enable additional
    |  tests:

+code(false, "bash").
    # make sure you are using recent pytest version
    python -m pip install -U pytest

    python -m pytest &lt;spacy-directory&gt; --vectors --model --slow

+h(2, "custom-location") Download model to custom location

p
    |   You can specify where #[code spacy.en.download] and
    |  #[code spacy.de.download] download the language model to using the
    |  #[code --data-path] or #[code -d] argument:

+code(false, "bash").
    python -m spacy.en.download all --data-path /some/dir

p
    |  If you choose to download to a custom location, you will need to tell
    |  spaCy where to load the model from in order to use it. You can do this
    |  either by calling #[code spacy.util.set_data_path()] before calling
    |  #[code spacy.load()], or by passing a #[code path] argument to the
    |  #[code spacy.en.English] or #[code spacy.de.German] constructors.
