## New Features {id="features",hidden="true"}

spaCy v2.2 features improved statistical models, new pretrained models for
Norwegian and Lithuanian, better Dutch NER, as well as a new mechanism for
storing language data that makes the installation about **5-10&times; smaller**
on disk. We've also added a new class to efficiently **serialize annotations**,
an improved and **10&times; faster** phrase matching engine, built-in scoring
and **CLI training for text classification**, a new command to analyze and
**debug training data**, data augmentation during training and more. For the
full changelog, see the
[release notes on GitHub](https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/releases/tag/v2.2.0).

For more details and a behind-the-scenes look at the new release,
[see our blog post](https://explosion.ai/blog/spacy-v2-2).

### Better pretrained models and more languages {id="models"}

> #### Example
>
> ```bash
> python -m spacy download nl_core_news_sm
> python -m spacy download nb_core_news_sm
> python -m spacy download lt_core_news_sm
> ```

The new version also features new and re-trained models for all languages and
resolves a number of data bugs. The [Dutch model](/models/nl) has been retrained
with a new and custom-labelled NER corpus using the same extended label scheme
as the English models. It should now produce significantly better NER results
overall. We've also added new core models for [Norwegian](/models/nb) (MIT) and
[Lithuanian](/models/lt) (CC BY-SA).

### Text classification scores and CLI training {id="train-textcat-cli"}

> #### Example
>
> ```bash
> $ python -m spacy train en /output /train /dev \\
> --pipeline textcat --textcat-arch simple_cnn \\
> --textcat-multilabel
> ```

When training your models using the `spacy train` command, you can now also
include text categories in the JSON-formatted training data. The `Scorer` and
`nlp.evaluate` now report the text classification scores, calculated as the
F-score on positive label for binary exclusive tasks, the macro-averaged F-score
for 3+ exclusive labels or the macro-averaged AUC ROC score for multilabel
classification.

**API:** [`spacy train`](/api/cli#train), [`Scorer`](/api/scorer),
[`Language.evaluate`](/api/language#evaluate)

</Infobox>

### New DocBin class to efficiently serialize Doc collections

> #### Example
>
> ```python
> from spacy.tokens import DocBin
> doc_bin = DocBin(attrs=["LEMMA", "ENT_IOB", "ENT_TYPE"], store_user_data=True)
> for doc in nlp.pipe(texts):
>     doc_bin.add(doc)
> bytes_data = doc_bin.to_bytes()
> # Deserialize later, e.g. in a new process
> nlp = spacy.blank("en")
> doc_bin = DocBin().from_bytes(bytes_data)
> docs = list(doc_bin.get_docs(nlp.vocab))
> ```

If you're working with lots of data, you'll probably need to pass analyses
between machines, either to use something like [Dask](https://dask.org) or
[Spark](https://spark.apache.org), or even just to save out work to disk. Often
it's sufficient to use the `Doc.to_array` functionality for this, and just
serialize the numpy arrays – but other times you want a more general way to save
and restore `Doc` objects.

The new `DocBin` class makes it easy to serialize and deserialize a collection
of `Doc` objects together, and is much more efficient than calling
`Doc.to_bytes` on each individual `Doc` object. You can also control what data
gets saved, and you can merge pallets together for easy map/reduce-style
processing.

### Serializable lookup tables and smaller installation {id="lookups"}

> #### Example
>
> ```python
> data = {"foo": "bar"}
> nlp.vocab.lookups.add_table("my_dict", data)
>
> def custom_component(doc):
>    table = doc.vocab.lookups.get_table("my_dict")
>    print(table.get("foo"))  # look something up
>    return doc
> ```

The new `Lookups` API lets you add large dictionaries and lookup tables to the
`Vocab` and access them from the tokenizer or custom components and extension
attributes. Internally, the tables use Bloom filters for efficient lookup
checks. They're also fully serializable out-of-the-box. All large data resources
like lemmatization tables have been moved to a separate package,
[`spacy-lookups-data`](https://github.com/explosion/spacy-lookups-data) that can
be installed alongside the core library. This allowed us to make the spaCy
installation **5-10&times; smaller on disk** (depending on your platform).
[Pretrained models](/models) now include their data files, so you only need to
install the lookups if you want to build blank models or use lemmatization with
languages that don't yet ship with pretrained models.

</Infobox>

### CLI command to debug and validate training data {id="debug-data"}

> #### Example
>
> ```bash
> $ python -m spacy debug-data en train.json dev.json
> ```

The new `debug-data` command lets you analyze and validate your training and
development data, get useful stats, and find problems like invalid entity
annotations, cyclic dependencies, low data labels and more. If you're training a
model with `spacy train` and the results seem surprising or confusing,
`debug-data` may help you track down the problems and improve your training
data.

To train a parser, your data should include at least 20 instances of each label.
⚠ Multiple root labels (ROOT, nsubj, aux, npadvmod, prep) found in
training data. spaCy's parser uses a single root label ROOT so this distinction
will not be available.

## Backwards incompatibilities {id="incompat"}

<Infobox title="Important note on models" variant="warning">

If you've been training **your own models**, you'll need to **retrain** them
with the new version. Also don't forget to upgrade all models to the latest
versions. Models for v2.0 or v2.1 aren't compatible with models for v2.2. To
check if all of your models are up to date, you can run the
[`spacy validate`](/api/cli#validate) command.

> #### Install with lookups data
>
> ```bash
> $ pip install spacy[lookups]
> ```
>
> You can also install
> [`spacy-lookups-data`](https://github.com/explosion/spacy-lookups-data)
> directly.

- The lemmatization tables have been moved to their own package,
  [`spacy-lookups-data`](https://github.com/explosion/spacy-lookups-data), which
  is not installed by default. If you're using pretrained models, **nothing
  changes**, because the tables are now included in the model packages. If you
  want to use the lemmatizer for other languages that don't yet have pretrained
  models (e.g. Turkish or Croatian) or start off with a blank model that
  contains lookup data (e.g. `spacy.blank("en")`), you'll need to **explicitly
  install spaCy plus data** via `pip install spacy[lookups]`.
- Lemmatization tables (rules, exceptions, index and lookups) are now part of
  the `Vocab` and serialized with it. This means that serialized objects (`nlp`,
  pipeline components, vocab) will now include additional data, and models
  written to disk will include additional files.
- The [`Lemmatizer`](/api/lemmatizer) class is now initialized with an instance
  of [`Lookups`](/api/lookups) containing the rules and tables, instead of dicts
  as separate arguments. This makes it easier to share data tables and modify
  them at runtime. This is mostly internals, but if you've been implementing a
  custom `Lemmatizer`, you'll need to update your code.
- The [Dutch model](/models/nl) has been trained on a new NER corpus (custom
  labelled UD instead of WikiNER), so their predictions may be very different
  compared to the previous version. The results should be significantly better
  and more generalizable, though.
- The [`spacy download`](/api/cli#download) command does **not** set the
  `--no-deps` pip argument anymore by default, meaning that model package
  dependencies (if available) will now be also downloaded and installed. If
  spaCy (which is also a model dependency) is not installed in the current
  environment, e.g. if a user has built from source, `--no-deps` is added back
  automatically to prevent spaCy from being downloaded and installed again from
  pip.
- The built-in
  [`biluo_tags_from_offsets`](/api/top-level#biluo_tags_from_offsets) converter
  is now stricter and will raise an error if entities are overlapping (instead
  of silently skipping them). If your data contains invalid entity annotations,
  make sure to clean it and resolve conflicts. You can now also use the new
  `debug-data` command to find problems in your data.
- Pipeline components can now overwrite IOB tags of tokens that are not yet part
  of an entity. Once a token has an `ent_iob` value set, it won't be reset to an
  "unset" state and will always have at least `O` assigned. `list(doc.ents)` now
  actually keeps the annotations on the token level consistent, instead of
  resetting `O` to an empty string.
- The default punctuation in the [`Sentencizer`](/api/sentencizer) has been
  extended and now includes more characters common in various languages. This
  also means that the results it produces may change, depending on your text. If
  you want the previous behavior with limited characters, set
  `punct_chars=[".", "!", "?"]` on initialization.
- The [`PhraseMatcher`](/api/phrasematcher) algorithm was rewritten from scratch
  and it's now 10&times; faster. The rewrite also resolved a few subtle bugs
  with very large terminology lists. So if you were matching large lists, you
  may see slightly different results – however, the results should now be fully
  correct. See [this PR](https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/pull/4309) for more
  details.
- The `Serbian` language class (introduced in v2.1.8) incorrectly used the
  language code `rs` instead of `sr`. This has now been fixed, so `Serbian` is
  now available via `spacy.lang.sr`.
- The `"sources"` in the `meta.json` have changed from a list of strings to a
  list of dicts. This is mostly internals, but if your code used
  `nlp.meta["sources"]`, you might have to update it.

### Migrating from spaCy 2.1 {id="migrating"}

#### Lemmatization data and lookup tables

If you application needs lemmatization for [languages](/usage/models#languages)
with only tokenizers, you now need to install that data explicitly via
`pip install spacy[lookups]` or `pip install spacy-lookups-data`. No additional
setup is required – the package just needs to be installed in the same
environment as spaCy.

```python {highlight="3-4"}
nlp = Turkish()
doc = nlp("Bu bir cümledir.")
# 🚨 This now requires the lookups data to be installed explicitly
print([token.lemma_ for token in doc])
```

The same applies to blank models that you want to update and train – for
instance, you might use [`spacy.blank`](/api/top-level#spacy.blank) to create a
blank English model and then train your own part-of-speech tagger on top. If you
don't explicitly install the lookups data, that `nlp` object won't have any
lemmatization rules available. spaCy will now show you a warning when you train
a new part-of-speech tagger and the vocab has no lookups available.

#### Lemmatizer initialization

This is mainly internals and should hopefully not affect your code. But if
you've been creating custom [`Lemmatizers`](/api/lemmatizer), you'll need to
update how they're initialized and pass in an instance of
[`Lookups`](/api/lookups) with the (optional) tables `lemma_index`, `lemma_exc`,
`lemma_rules` and `lemma_lookup`.

```diff
from spacy.lemmatizer import Lemmatizer
+ from spacy.lookups import Lookups

lemma_index = {"verb": ("cope", "cop")}
lemma_exc = {"verb": {"coping": ("cope",)}}
lemma_rules = {"verb": [["ing", ""]]}
- lemmatizer = Lemmatizer(lemma_index, lemma_exc, lemma_rules)
+ lookups = Lookups()
+ lookups.add_table("lemma_index", lemma_index)
+ lookups.add_table("lemma_exc", lemma_exc)
+ lookups.add_table("lemma_rules", lemma_rules)
+ lemmatizer = Lemmatizer(lookups)
```

#### Converting entity offsets to BILUO tags

If you've been using the
[`biluo_tags_from_offsets`](/api/top-level#biluo_tags_from_offsets) helper to
convert character offsets into token-based BILUO tags, you may now see an error
if the offsets contain overlapping tokens and make it impossible to create a
valid BILUO sequence. This is helpful, because it lets you spot potential
problems in your data that can lead to inconsistent results later on. But it
also means that you need to adjust and clean up the offsets before converting
them:

```diff
doc = nlp("I live in Berlin Kreuzberg")
- entities = [(10, 26, "LOC"), (10, 16, "GPE"), (17, 26, "LOC")]
+ entities = [(10, 16, "GPE"), (17, 26, "LOC")]
tags = get_biluo_tags_from_offsets(doc, entities)
```

#### Serbian language data

If you've been working with `Serbian` (introduced in v2.1.8), you'll need to
change the language code from `rs` to the correct `sr`:

```diff
- from spacy.lang.rs import Serbian
+ from spacy.lang.sr import Serbian
```
