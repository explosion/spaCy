# spaCy contributor agreement

This spaCy Contributor Agreement (**"SCA"**) is based on the
[Oracle Contributor Agreement](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/oca-405177.pdf).
The SCA applies to any contribution that you make to any product or project
managed by us (the **"project"**), and sets out the intellectual property rights
you grant to us in the contributed materials. The term **"us"** shall mean
[ExplosionAI GmbH](https://explosion.ai/legal). The term
**"you"** shall mean the person or entity identified below.

If you agree to be bound by these terms, fill in the information requested
below and include the filled-in version with your first pull request, under the
folder [`.github/contributors/`](/.github/contributors/). The name of the file
should be your GitHub username, with the extension `.md`. For example, the user
example_user would create the file `.github/contributors/example_user.md`.

Read this agreement carefully before signing. These terms and conditions
constitute a binding legal agreement.
